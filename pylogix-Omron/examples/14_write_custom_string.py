Write to a custom size string

WHen you create a custom size string, it is essentially
a UDT.  We cannot write to them in the same way that we
can write to a standard size string.

In this case, we're going to write some text to the tag
String20, which is a custom string STRING20.  We not only
have to write the data, we have to also write the length.
